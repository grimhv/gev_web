## gev_web

This is a web frontend for Gev -> https://github.com/grimhv/gev

This lets you upload an archived event log file, then, using Gev, filter events based on search criteria.  Javascript handles AJAX, building the HTML table, and pagination while PHP builds a command to run Gev.exe based on form input.
